#### 1. [Quiz Game](./quiz_game.py)

This is a small simple program that asks the user few simple questions about the computer and outputs the number of questions answered correctly and the percentage score.

The project utilizes multiple if statements to determine whether the user has entered the right anser or not.

#### 2. [Number Guesser](./number_guesser.py)

This takes advantage of the random library to randomly select a number within a given range. It the asks the user to guess what number the computer has selected. When the user guesses the correct number, the programs quits and outputs the number of guesses made.

The project utilizes the concept of loops using a while loop. It also uses multiple if statements and the Python random library.

#### 3. [Rock Paper Scissors Game](./rock_paper_scissors.py)

This is a very popular game being played between the user and the computer.
The program receives the user's option through an input method.
It randomnly selects an option toplay against the user using the random library.
The program checks whether the user has won, tied or lost using conditional statements.  
This process is repeated using a while loop until the user inputs 'q' or terminates the program.  
The program then outputs the user's and computer's scores before wishing the user a goodbye.

The project utilizes lists, Python library (random), conditional statements and while loop.
